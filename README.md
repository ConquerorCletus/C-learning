## Why i am Currently learning C
- I am Currently undergoing the ALX africa software engineering program for 2023, and it is the first programming language introduced to me in the program.
- If i can pick up  C, i will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar.
- C has a wide range of applications; in operating systems, databases, embedded systems and even some android phones if not most.
